# yahoofinancescrape
Very simple and inefficient yahoo finance scraper of selected stocks. Calculates the profits from bought value, prints to screen and then prints to file for later use in a graph.
To make it work, you first need to;
  - Go to Yahoo Finances in your browser
  - Refuse the cookies
  - Press F12 then go to the storage tab and then to cookies
  - Copy and paste every cookie there to the code in python
  - Input in the "investment" dictionary the investments, stocks, and links of the stocks bought.

I repeat, this is very inefficient (it takes way too long to setup and about 1.65 seconds to load every time), i highly recommend you use something else.
I created this for fun using the basic knowledge i had, and since i can simply use it as a startup script (cookies last for about a year) it doesn't bother me.
